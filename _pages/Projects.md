### Validating Attribution Techniques using Deep Learning | CNN, XAI, PyTorch ((May 2023 – Sept 2023))

- Aims to validate the robustness of saliency attribution techniques, providing explanations for model predictions.
- Randomly sampled 113 images from the training set and generated over 16,000 perturbed images, providing a
robust foundation for conducting experiments and assessing model performance on unseen data.
- Implemented various attribution methods including GradCAM, SmoothgradCAM++, ScoreCAM and LayerCAM
and tested it against ResNet18, ResNet50, VGG16, InceptionV3
- Used occlusion-based perturbation and adversarial noise assessment to reveal vulnerabilities and limitations in
popular attribution methods, clarifying model interpretability, region sensitivity, and saliency map reliability.
- Leveraged advanced metrics including Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Earth Mover’s Distance, Area under Curve, Similarity, and Normalised Scanpath Saliency to provide comprehensive insights and rigorous evaluation.

### Spam Detection using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) | RNN, TensorFlow (Jan 2024)

- Conducted data preprocessing, including cleaning and transformation, utilizing the Pandas library.
- Implemented LSTM architecture followed by a dense layer employing a sigmoid activation function.
- Utilized the Adam optimizer, binary crossentropy loss function, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.
- Visualized the loss and accuracy metrics using Matplotlib for both training and validation datasets.

### COVID-19 Data Analytics and Reporting using Azure | Data Factory, Databricks, PowerBI, SQL (Dec 2023)

- Built a solution architecture using Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake, Databricks, PoweBI and HDInsight.
- Integrated data from HTTP clients, Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Gen2 using Azure Data Factory.
- Created ADF pipelines to execute HDInsight activities and Databricks Notebook to carry out data transformations
- Created CI/CD pipeline for releasing Azure Data factory artefacts for deployment.

### Chatbot using Transformers in PyTorch | Transformers, PyTorch (Nov 2024)

- Demonstrated the benefits of data-driven employee assignment & improved allocation of service employees.
- Utilized BigQuery, AutoML, BigQuery ML and Vertex AI for data exploration and training, Google data Studio
(Looker) for visualizations.
- Used Python and Flask to create the User Interface (UI) and deployed it in Google App Engine (GAE).
- Employed Google Distance Matrix API for calculation of distances to client sites.

### Movie Recommendation System using ML | Python, TKinter, SVD (Feb 2019 - June 2019)

- Spearheaded team of three, building a Collaborative based Movie Recommendation System leveraging Python.
- Implemented the SVD algorithm to mitigate MSE and RMSE and enhance system accuracy.
- Utilized Tkinter, as GUI, to design and develop an intuitive and visually compelling user interface.
