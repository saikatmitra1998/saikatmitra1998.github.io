Welcome to my digital space! I’m Saikat Mitra, a data and AI enthusiast currently based in Munich, Germany, driven by the endless possibilities of AI and its real-world impact.

I’m currently working as an AI Consultant at Allianz Services, where I focus on building Generative AI solutions, especially around Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to develop intelligent, context-aware systems that improve decision-making and productivity across business domains.

Before this, I was part of a pioneering project at Allianz Technology, where I contributed to making the organization GenAI-enabled—from identifying use cases to building PoCs that integrate large language models into enterprise workflows.

Earlier, I completed a research internship at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), where I worked with transformer-based architectures to synthesize artificial data from over 20 years of German National Transport data. The goal was to augment mobility datasets for training deep learning models in transport analytics—a challenging but incredibly rewarding project that sat at the intersection of data engineering and applied machine learning.

During my academic journey, I also served as a Teaching Assistant for Data Mining at Otto von Guericke University. There, I supported curriculum updates, crafted hands-on exercises, and created engaging content to help students build a solid foundation in data science.

My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, LLMs, RAG, AI Agents and tools like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Databricks, Docker, with hands-on experience deploying machine learning and generative AI pipelines on GCP, Azure, and AWS.

I’m always open to collaborating on innovative AI projects or having conversations about data, GenAI, and machine learning. Feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or email—I’d love to connect!
