Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm Saikat Mitra, a data enthusiast based in Stuttgart, Germany. With a passion for unraveling insights from complex datasets, I'm on a mission to harness the power of data to drive innovation and solve real-world challenges. I am currently working on my Master Thesis at the German Aerospace Center (DLR).

My programming skills span Python, SQL, JavaScript, and R. I possess in-depth experience with tools and frameworks such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, AWS, PyTorch, Databricks, and Docker. These skills have empowered me to create an ML infrastructure on different cloud platforms be it for research or business requirements.

In addition to my roles in the industry, I have worked as a Teaching Assistant for Data Mining at Otto von Guericke University.

I aim to continue utilizing my skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions that enhance operational efficiencies and deliver business value.
